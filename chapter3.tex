\section{Introduction}
\label{intro-chapter}
Facial expression analysis (FEA) is the challenging task over the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer vision. FEA demands in many applications such as criminals expression analysis, entertainment, surveillance in public transportation, patient mood analysis, student interest in online classes, customer satisfaction etc. probably statistical methods have been applying with the combination of classification algorithms such as ANN, SVM etc. but still expecting more accurate results.
Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) becoming more popular in web data mining methods. Which belongs to a research field of image analysis, also known as Query By Image Content (QBIC) and Content- Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR). The key technologies image retrieval include: Image feature extraction, feature-based similarity calculation, semantically relevance feedback and image acquisition. It relates to machine vision, pattern recognition, database technology and information retrieval studies[18].Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) from unannotated image databases is a wide and versatile field of research interests. With fast and dramatic growth of internet culture, huge digital images produced by scientific, educational, medical, industrial, and other applications. To efficiently utilize this huge growing data, there is need of intelligent, accurate, effective, and efficient content based image retrieval system and image database management systems. The problems of metadata based image retrieval and rapid growth in the quantity and availability of digital images motivates research into automatic image retrieval. In contrast to traditional images retrieval, Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) uses the information that is already available in the Image[19].CBIR either using local features such as color, texture, shape and spatial layout etc [20][21]22] using computer vision techniques among others or high level features like soft computing techniques as neural networks, fuzzy logic and machine algorithms etc [23][24]. The idea of local patterns is adopted to propose the maximum edge positions is classified into two categories which are named as sign maximum edge position and magnitude maximum edge positions for octal patterns[3]. In CBIR using color edge detection technique, image is converted from RGB to YCbCr color space. After this on Y plane, canny edge detection technique is applied and then planes of an image are combined and again color space conversion from YCbCr to RGB is done. Image Histogram is calculated for each plane of resultant image. Finally discrete wavelet transform is applied on the Histogram to get feature vector of reduced size .Content Based Image Retrieval turning out to be more notorious in web information mining strategies. Which has a place with an examination field of image investigation, called Query By Image Content (QBIC) and Content-Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR). The key advances image retrieval include: Image feature extraction, feature based similitude estimation, semantically pertinence criticism and image procurement. It identifies with machine vision, design acknowledgment, database innovation and data retrieval studies[18].Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) from agitated image databases is a wide and flexible field of examination hobbies. With quick and sensational development of web society, colossal advanced images delivered by logical, instructive, therapeutic, modern, and different applications. To proficiently use this tremendous developing information, there is need of astute, exact, viable, and effective substance based image retrieval framework and image database administration frameworks. The issues of metadata based image retrieval and fast development in the amount and accessibility of advanced images persuades research into programmed image retrieval. Rather than customary images retrieval, Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) utilizes the data that is as of now accessible in the Image[19].


\section{Problem Statement, Objectives, and Contributions}  
This thesis develops the techniques for optimizing the energy consumption in a cloud data center, evaluates and expose the limitations of the existing practices and tackles forecasting data center energy consumption for better planning and operations of the data centers and proposes a taxonomy on metrics available to analyze energy efficiency of the data centers. We have investigated the following research problems :
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1
\end{itemize}


To address these problems, we formulate the following   research specific  objectives.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The objective of the proposed research work is to analyze the image data to retrieve the correct image from the database helpful to retrieve the correct data from existing image database in crime analysis, online commercial web sites and facial expression analysis useful to identifying the moods of a person to analyze the situation in many real world applications like medical, military, entertainment, crime etc.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Directional Local Patterns are recommended to textural feature extraction for facial expression recognition and also mining the facial expressions to avoid the indiscriminant patterns.	
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
%		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter1/figures/fig1}
		\caption{(a) 3 X 3 pixel format surrounding the center pixel and 8 neighboring pixels (b) differences among   center pixel and surrounding pixels (c) Substituted with binary (0, 1) values}
		\label{fig:fig1}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
	%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter1/figures/fig2}
		\caption{Calculation of LTP, the ternary patterns are split in to upper and lower patterns by substituting ‘1’ for ‘+1’ to get upper binary pattern and ‘1’ for ‘-1’ for lower binary pattern in both the cases ‘0’ for ‘0’’s.}
		\label{fig:fig2}
	\end{figure}
	
	\item local patterns are generated from the low level features such as color, texture and shape. Textural pattern splay an imperative role to extract the local information like edges, texture of surface etc. Local patterns have been calculated from relationship of the pixel values of every pixel like LBP, LTP are calculated base on the first order calculation (difference) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fig1} and Fig. \ref{fig:fig2}. local binary patterns are proved better for face recognition but LBP is suffering from discrimination as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:lbppattern} (will get the same patterns for two cases) of pixel intensity values. Proposed work overcome this problem by dividing the range of differences based threshold value.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Classify and generalize the decision making process using suitable selection of algorithms such as machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms for facial emotional expressions to reduce the semantic gap without ambiguity.
	\end{itemize}	
	\begin{figure}
		\centering
%		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{chapter1/figures/LbpPattern}
		\caption{Example for generating same LBP (00100111) pattern for both textures with large and small intensity values}

		\label{fig:lbpltp}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	\item Retrieving the feature extraction is the prominent step in image retrieval that will be done by pattern generation as shown in Fig. 4 using different patterns. Furthermore, the next important step is classification of images like for our work expression classification i.e. happy, surprise, sad, disgust, angry, neutral etc. for  this machine learning is proved better but still there is a gap so, we would like to enhance the usage of combinational algorithms and also applying deep learning algorithms to get better results compared to earlier.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To improve the Facial Expression Recognition Rate, Precision and Recall to get better results in different applications.	
	\end{itemize}
	
	
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}
%The-state-of-art escalation in the digital data production steadily due to the dominant use of internet and digital equipment in various fields such as medical \cite{mitra2002unsupervised,zhang2001segmentation}, entertainment, education, media, online business etc. becoming by keywords. This makes the system cumbersome to manage the abundant data is and human annotations as if in text- based systems. Therefore, here is a tremendous call for an efficient system to retrieve the precise images from the massive database rather than labels. Today Content based image retrieval (CBIR) system is the most well-known system for some applications, CBIR consists the important and essential steps such as feature extraction, relevance feedback, similarity measurements etc., and here feature extraction is the most prominent step in pre-processing that depends on the technique make use of extract the features from the only image like local data as color, texture, shape, human faces etc., further features are categorized into local features such as color features, layout, shape features and texture \cite{deng2001efficient,manjunath2001color} and high-level features such as faces, biometric, neural networks etc. To retrieve an accurate image with the help of one and only feature is arduous due to the probability of user taking photographs in any direction like several regions which include random direction of capturing of image, optical device, uneven illumination and that of posing expressions, relevance feedback etc. \cite{jing2004relevance,su2003relevance} so the system demands the combination of two or multiple features and filtering process. A general and upgraded survey is typified in the further sections.

\section{Review of Local Textural Patterns for Facial Feature Extraction}
The section presents the comprehensive survey on the, local patterns such as LBP, LTP, LTRP etc. texture analysis and retrieval are important and to be in a tight corner in the field of CBIR. Textures are most useful in retrieving of tiles, facial expressions, fabric, clouds, animal skin etc. 

Rui et al. \cite{rui1999image} presented a survey on the image feature representation and extraction, multidimensional indexing, and system design. 
Moghaddam et al. \cite{moghaddam2006gabor} have improved the Gabor wavelet correlogram (GWC) for image indexing and retrieving and address the redundancy problem \cite{moghaddam2006gabor}. Further they proposed evolutionary group algorithm to optimize the weights which improve the  evaluation measures  \cite{Moghaddam2007novel}.  Ojala et al. \cite{pietikainen2000rotation} used the G statistic metric to compare feature distributions and they derived the feature distribution using local texture operator on texture image. 
%Ying Liu presents and analyzes high level features for CBIR such as machine learning tools, object ontology, semantic template, and neural networks to reduce the semantic gap (n.d.).
 Zhao et al. \cite{zhao2007dynamic} developed dynamic texture for face recognition with facial expressions using the volume local binary patterns (vlbps).  Lei et al. \cite{lei2010face} used local binary pattern analysis to find the neighboring relationship and face representations are developed by convolving the face image with a Gabor filter bank. Chen et al. \cite{chen2002region,chen2005clue} developed a fuzzy logic approach and color representation based on clustering in a given region. Ojala et al. \cite{ojala1996comparative} perform evaluation of the state of the art  texture measures and local binary patterns(lbps) for texture retrieval. Zhang  et al. \cite{zhang2009local} proposed high order LDP to retrieve the more required information and used several spatial relationships found in a given segment. Subrahmanyam et al. \cite{subrahmanyam2012local} combined  local maximum edge binary patterns with Gabor transform. 
 %Amalgamation of color and texture features used for feature extraction from an image in CBIR system that extended to retrieve sub images \cite{murthy2014detection}.
  Majumder et al. \cite{majumder2016automatic} developed a deep neural network for automatic facial expression recognition that consist of auto-encoders and classifier. 

Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used in face recognition.
The face image is divided into small regions and apply LBP to these local regions to extract local descriptor and finally combining all these local LBP features will give the global feature histogram \cite{ahonen2006face}. Zhao et al. \cite{zhao2007dynamic} modeled textures with VLBP, combining motion and appearance and co-occurrences of lbp operator on orthogonal planes. 
%High-order Local Derivative Pattern(LDP) for face recognition and local binary patterns(LBP) to detain the more feature than that of the first-order derivatives \cite{zhang2009local}.
